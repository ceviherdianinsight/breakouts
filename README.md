#### 2. What are Breakouts?

1. Definition

* A breakout occurs when price escapes from a defined range with strong directional momentum.
* It signifies a shift in market balance, when buyers or sellers overpower the other side after a period of equilibrium.
* Example:
  - Between Oct 3 – Dec 19, 2018, USD/JPY was range-bound between 114.55 (high) and 111.37 (low) (~300 pips).
  - On Dec 20, price broke below 111.37, continuing to fall 662 pips to 104.66 — a textbook downward breakout.
    
2. Characteristics of Breakouts
* Breakouts occur across all time frames — from minutes to months.
* Identifying them involves some subjectivity, but certain rules help determine which are more meaningful.
* A simple breakout can be defined as the price making new highs or lows beyond a previous range.
  
3. Four Key Rules for Evaluating Breakout Strength
* Rule 1: Time Frame Importance:
  - Breakouts on higher time frames are more significant than those on lower ones.
  - Example: A 50-day high matters much more than a 50-minute high.
* Rule 2: Range Width & Duration
  - The narrower and longer a range has held, the stronger the potential breakout.
  - Example:
    - A 300-pip range lasting 100 days → stronger breakout
    - A 500-pip range lasting 20 days → weaker breakout.
* Rule 3: Relative Extremes: Breakouts that push to long-term highs or lows tend to produce stronger and more sustained trends than short-term ones.
* Rule 4: Post-Breakout Behavior
  - What happens after the breakout indicates its strength:
    - If price holds beyond the breakout level, momentum is likely to continue.
    - Example: EUR/USD breaks above 1.1000 and stays above for several days → bullish continuation likely.
4. Key Takeaways
* Breakouts represent powerful shifts in market sentiment.
* To filter high-quality breakouts, focus on:
  - Higher time frames
  - Tight, long-lasting ranges
  - Long-term highs/lows
  - Sustained price behavior beyond breakout level
