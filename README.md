#### 2. What are Breakouts?

1. Definition
* A breakout occurs when price escapes from a defined range with strong directional momentum.
* It signifies a shift in market balance, when buyers or sellers overpower the other side after a period of equilibrium.
* Example:
  - Between Oct 3 – Dec 19, 2018, USD/JPY was range-bound between 114.55 (high) and 111.37 (low) (~300 pips).
  - On Dec 20, price broke below 111.37, continuing to fall 662 pips to 104.66 — a textbook downward breakout.
